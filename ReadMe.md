# Hack-A-Thing 2: React Native Readme
## Liam Jolley, January 2020

### What I Learned:
Through intense trial and error, I learned how to efficiently use Expo to manage my iOS development, timeline, and deployment. I also refreshed my React skills from taking CS52 while also learning how to apply them to React Native. I also experimented with different React Native testing libraries.
