# Hack-A-Thing 2: React Native Readme
## Liam Jolley, January 2020
### Thing Description:
I went through two React Native tutorials, the first via Tim's CS52 page and the second via LinkedIn Learning. For the first, I coded a YouTube querying engine. For the second, began coding a logic game.


### Who Did What:
I did not work with a partner.


### What I Learned:
Through intense trial and error, I learned how to efficiently use Expo to manage my iOS development, timeline, and deployment. I also refreshed my React skills from taking CS52 while also learning how to apply them to React Native. I also experimented with different React Native testing libraries.

### What Didn't Work:
I'm still struggling to deploy an app on my phone via Expo and have been able to use only the emulator to display the apps. I also did not get all the way through the game app development.
